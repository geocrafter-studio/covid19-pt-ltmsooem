# covid19-pt-ltmsooem
Portuguese COVID19 curated dataset

***WARNING: LTMSOOEM stands for: Let's try make something out of ESRI mess***

Challenged by [Ramiz Sami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramizsami/) the author of [thecoronamap.com](https://www.thecoronamap.com) in order to deliver more insight information at country specific level we started to inspect the information provided by Portuguese national health organization [DGS](https://www.dgs.pt).

We realized the data provided by an [ESRI dashboard](https://covid19.min-saude.pt/ponto-de-situacao-atual-em-portugal/) was hard to find/track/maintain/update...in a word, a mess!

This is our tentative to curate Portuguese COVID19 datasets provided by Portuguese health authorities and make it more open and 'geo-friendly'!
